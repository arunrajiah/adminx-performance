Comprehensive performance optimization plugin with caching, CSS/JS minification, image optimization, and database cleanup.

== Description ==

AdminX Performance is a comprehensive WordPress performance optimization plugin designed to make your website faster and more efficient. This plugin combines multiple optimization techniques into one easy-to-use solution.

**Key Features:**

* **Page Caching** - Automatically cache pages for faster load times with smart cache invalidation
* **CSS/JS Optimization** - Minify and combine CSS/JavaScript files to reduce file sizes and HTTP requests
* **Image Optimization** - Compress images on upload with WebP support for modern browsers
* **Database Cleanup** - Remove unnecessary data like revisions, spam comments, and expired transients
* **Scheduled Optimization** - Automatic database optimization and cache management

**Performance Benefits:**

* Faster page load times through intelligent caching
* Reduced bandwidth usage with optimized assets
* Improved Core Web Vitals scores
* Better user experience and SEO rankings
* Reduced server load and resource usage

**Local Processing:**

All optimization processes run locally on your server - no external API calls or third-party dependencies required. Your data stays on your server for maximum privacy and security.

**Easy to Use:**

* Simple one-click optimization tools
* Detailed performance statistics and reports
* Automatic optimization with manual override options
* Clean, intuitive admin interface

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with other caching plugins? =

AdminX Performance includes its own caching system. We recommend disabling other caching plugins to avoid conflicts, though the plugin is designed to work alongside most other optimization tools.

= Will this plugin slow down my admin area? =

No, AdminX Performance only optimizes the frontend of your website. The admin area performance is not affected by the optimization features.

= Can I exclude certain pages from caching? =

Yes, the plugin automatically excludes admin pages, user-specific content, and POST requests from caching. Additional exclusion options are available in the settings.

= Is image optimization reversible? =

Image optimization compresses the original files. We recommend backing up your media library before running bulk optimization. Individual images can be re-uploaded if needed.

= How often does database cleanup run? =

By default, database cleanup runs weekly. You can disable automatic cleanup and run it manually from the Tools section, or adjust the schedule in the settings.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =

Yes, AdminX Performance is compatible with WooCommerce and automatically excludes cart, checkout, and account pages from caching to ensure proper functionality.

= What image formats are supported for optimization? =

The plugin supports JPEG, PNG, and GIF images. WebP generation is available for JPEG and PNG images when your server supports it.

= Can I revert optimization settings? =

Yes, all optimization features can be disabled at any time. Cached files and optimized assets can be cleared using the tools provided in the admin interface.
